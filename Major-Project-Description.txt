Problem statement

"Learning to code can be challenging, especially for beginners who may feel isolated and unsupported. Traditional programming resources may not provide the level of support and interaction that learners need. Codemates aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive online platform that empowers learners of all levels and backgrounds to learn and grow together, with features such as live programming sessions, an AI assistant for debugging, and communication with mentors."
